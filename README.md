# Credit-Risk-Analysis

Abstract

Currently there are many machine learning models that have been deployed to predict whether a person will default their loan amount or pay it back. These decisions are made using predictive modelling and ML by using various factors of the person, such as their education level, sex, personal status, checking amount, number of savings bonds and a lot more. The aim of this project to use one such publicly available datasets, the Statlog - German Credit Risk Dataset which has anonymized data of many customers of a bank, with their personal details and whether or not they've defaulted their loan amount. Within this project I aim to first pre-process the data into both user readable and machine readable format, explore the data and derive inferences, and finally use this to predict whether if a person will default their loan or not.
